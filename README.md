> Angular CLI builder that runs your application in the desktop using Electron

The builder runs your Angular application in `serve` mode and loads it in an Electron window. Notice that the builder currently assumes that you are serving your application on the default port 4200.

You can pass the following options:
* `--project`: the name of the project on which you want to install it. It is useful in multi-project workspaces such as Nx DevTools.

ng run [project-name]:desktop
```
